## Progress so far

I've been playing [Idle RPG](https://idlerpg.newnet.net/), in as much as one
can actually play it, on Newnet IRC. So far, my character bfj the Atheist
Paladin has attained level 35. He's got a pair of level 40 leggings which I'd
guess keep him pretty warm while roaming the wastes.

You can follow progress at [my player page](https://idlerpg.newnet.net/playerview.php?player=bfj).
